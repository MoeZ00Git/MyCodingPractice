 Four other Oysters followed them,
      And yet another four;
And thick and fast they came at last,
      And more, and more, and more -
All hopping through the frothy waves,
      And scrambling to the shore.

The Walrus and the Carpenter
      Walked on a mile or so,
And then they rested on a rock
      Conveniently low:
And all the little Oysters stood
      And waited in a row.

'The time has come,' the Walrus said,
      'To talk of many things:
Of shoes - and ships - and sealing-wax -
      Of cabbages - and kings -
And why the sea is boiling hot -
      And whether pigs have wings.'
